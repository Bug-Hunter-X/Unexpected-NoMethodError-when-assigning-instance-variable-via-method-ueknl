This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in Ruby related to instance variable access and assignment. The `bug.rb` file shows a `MyClass` that allows setting instance variables directly via `instance_variable_set`.  This is generally discouraged as it bypasses the intended method access, leading to potential maintenance issues and unintended side effects.  The solution showcases the preferred way to modify instance variables through appropriate getter and setter methods, promoting better code organization, encapsulation, and maintainability.
